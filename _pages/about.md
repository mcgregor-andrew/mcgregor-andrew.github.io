Hi, I'm a Professor in the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](http://www.cs.umass.edu/) at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/). I'm a member of the [Theory Group](http://theory.cs.umass.edu/people.html) and my research is in algorithms and complexity. Specific topics of interest include processing massive data sets and data streams, clustering, approximation algorithms, coding and information theory. Here are my [research papers](research/research.html). 

Prior to UMass, I spent a great couple of years at [Microsoft Research  (Silicon Valley)](http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/labs/siliconvalley/default.aspx) and the [Information Theory and Applications Center](http://www.ita.ucsd.edu) at [UCSD](http://www.ucsd.edu/). In 2007,
I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu").
During graduate school, I spent a summer at [DIMACS](http://www.dimacs.rutgers.edu/) and three summers at the Fundamental Maths Department at Bell Labs. In the dim and distant past, I received the [Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics](http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/prospective/part-iii) (2001) and a B.A. in Mathematics (2000) from the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/).
